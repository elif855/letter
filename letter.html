<h2>Dear Eileen,</h2>
  Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Faculty of Science at  <a href=http://example.com/>Université Génialissime</a> to <br/>study for your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br/>

 <h2>Start dates</h2>
  We are happy that you can start your studies with us at any time, but we prefer that you start at the <br/> beginning of a semester; the start dates for each semester are as follows:

    <ul>
      <li>First semester: September 9, 2016</li>
      <li>Second semester: January 15, 2017</li>
      <li>Third semester: May 2, 2017</li>
   </ul> <br/>
  Please let me know if this is right for you, and if so, which start date you prefer.

<h2>Study subjects</h2>
  In the Faculty of Genius Sciences, we have a great openness in research, as long as the subjects fall <br/>within the field of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent and dedicated researcher, just <br/>the kind of person we would like to have on our team. That said, among the ideas you submitted, <br/>the ones that intrigued us the most are the following, in order of priority:<br/> <br/>
 
 <ul> Turning H<sub>2</sub>O   into wine, and the health benefits of resveratro C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub><br/>
Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures above 30°C (86°F),when <br/> audience size increases exponentially (effect from 3 × 10 <sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10 <sup>4</sup>.)<br/>
Constructions in HTML and CSS for the representation of musical scores.</ul><br/> <br/> 
  Can you provide us with more information on each of these topics, including the expected duration of the <br/>research, the staff and other resources needed, and anything else we should know? Thank you. <br/> <br/>
  
Please accept, Madam, the expression of my distinguished sentiments, <br/> 
  <strong>Dr Eleanor Gaye</strong> <br/> <br/>
